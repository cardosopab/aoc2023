# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions and implementations for the Advent of Code 2023 challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event featuring daily programming puzzles for the first 25 days of December, designed to test problem-solving and coding skills, for the chance of earning two stars per day, at a total of 50. Which will complete the Advent ascii art! :D

## Structure

- Each day's challenge has its own directory named `dayXX`, where `XX` represents the day number.
- Inside each day's directory, you'll find two python files, named `part1.py`, and `part2.py`.
- You'll also find at least two txt files, respectavely named `example.txt` and `puzzle.txt` which are used as input for the respective day's problem.

## Acknowledgments

Happy coding and enjoy Advent of Code 2023!
